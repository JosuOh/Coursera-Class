                <p>Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections 
                    (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. 
                    You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the 
                    sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window.</p>
                <div class="r-corner" id="step1">
                    Step 1
                </div>

            <div class="sec col-md-6 col-lg-4" id="second">
                <p>You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, 
                    and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width 
                    of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width 
                    of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should 
                    appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.</p>

            <div class="sec col-md-12 col-lg-4" id="third">
                <p>Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always 
                positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet 
                or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) 
                or come up with your own.</p>
